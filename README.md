This project is a Rubikâ€™s Cube Solver that takes a scrambled cube as input and returns the optimal or near-optimal solution to solve it. The solver supports visual representation, user interaction, and algorithmic solving using standard cube notation.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Interactive 3D/2D Rubik's Cube interface (optional, if included)

âœ… Step-by-step solving guide using standard cube notations

âœ… Implements well-known algorithms (DFS , BFS)

âœ… Supports manual input or automatic face color detection (if integrated with a camera or file input)

âœ… Fast and efficient solve time
